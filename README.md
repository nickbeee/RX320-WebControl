# RX320-WebControl
Web-based controller for the Ten-Tec RX320 DSP General Coverage receiver

Originally written around 2006. This is a web-based controller for the RX320 receiver using Perl CGI scripts. 
It was written to run on a Win32 system using win32::SerialPort to to communicate with the receiver, however I see no reason 
why it couldn't be modified to run on any Linux or BSD system by using the appropriate serial port Perl module.
